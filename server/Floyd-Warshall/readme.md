<ds>
 - first row will contain the value of node we are currently as intermediate node i.e. k {i to j via k}
 - second row will contain the distance of each node from the source node
 - third row will contain the predecessor node of each node
</ds>


<adj>
- first row will contain the node from which we are checking the distance and its distance from source node.
- then the following lines will contain all the other nodes to which we are checking if a route is present via k.

- format of each row will be same as specified in the djikstra algorithm.
